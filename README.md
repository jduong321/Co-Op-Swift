# Co-Op-Swift

Problem: In our software development class the professor would make us utilize IceScrum in order to keep organize in a way related to 
agile development. He told us many students did not like how IceScrum was and so our semester project was to create something better than
IceScrum.

Release And Sprints: In order to replicate the rugby approach of scrum, we had 2 releases that had 2 sprints each. During these sprints
we would taketurns as Scrum Master in order to keep the project going.

Release 1: This first scenario was suppose to contain the initial the basic graphic user interface(GUI). This would consist of a login page,
a project page, and a create new project page. At this time we also set up our SQL database which would contain the tables of what we wanted
to keep such as user info and their projects.

Release 2: After the GUI was done, we wanted a system of creating a project, inviting members, adding stories to the sandbox, assigning people
via task tree, and then having a peer-review for the team. Everything done was added to the database to keep record of it.

Final: At the end of the semester we managed to get everything we said we would done.
